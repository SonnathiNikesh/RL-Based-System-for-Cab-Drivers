# RL-Based-System-for-Cab-Drivers

In this cutthroat industry, the majority of drivers receive a sizable number of rides from clients during the day. However, many drivers are complaining that despite an increase in income, their profits are not rising as a result of the recent increases in petrol and power prices. For drivers to optimise their earnings throughout the day, selecting the appropriate rides is crucial. In our initiative, we help taxi drivers maximise their revenues by applying Reinforcement Learning.

Our project's objective is to create an RL-based algorithm that will let taxi drivers to make better decisions while they're out in the field, therefore increasing their earnings.

At 3 PM, for instance, a driver may receive three requests for rides. The first one will take him to a place where it is doubtful that he will get another ride for the next few hours, but it is a long-distance journey that guarantees a high cost. Although the second one ends up in a better place, he has to make a small diversion to pick up the customer, which increases the cost of petrol. Choosing option number three could be the greatest option since, despite its medium distance, it will probably find him another ride later on and save him from most of the traffic.
